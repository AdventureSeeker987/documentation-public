Use `@orderly.network/hooks` to get the chains that are supported by Orderly.

```typescript
import { useChains } from "@orderly.network/hooks";

const [chains, { findByChainId }] = useChains();
```

The `findByChainId` function can be used to get the config of a particular chain by the chain id.

```typescript /findByChainId/
import { useChains } from "@orderly.network/hooks";

const [_, { findByChainId }] = useChains();

const chain = findByChainId(421613);
```
