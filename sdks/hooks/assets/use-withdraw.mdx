## Terminology

### Max withdrawable amount

`maxAmount` - The maximum balance that can be withdrawn at this moment (without having to settle PnL).

### Available Balance

`availableBalance` - The available balance of the account, which is equal to the amount that can be withdrawn after settling all oustanding unsettled PnL.

### Unsettled PnL

`unsettledPnL` - Amount of PnL that has not been settled into the account balance yet. Balance will be available to withdraw once PnL has been settled (if positive).

All of the above data can be retrieved through `useWithdraw`.

```typescript
const { withdraw, isLoading, maxAmount, availableBalance, unsettledPnL } = useWithdraw();
```

## Withdraw

### `useWithdraw()`

```typescript
import { useWithdraw } from "@orderly.network/hooks";

const { withdraw, isLoading } = useWithdraw();

const res = await withdraw();
```
