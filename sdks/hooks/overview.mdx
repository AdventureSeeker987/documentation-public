`@orderly.network/hooks`

The hooks libraries provides a series of React hooks for React developers to ensure a seamless integration experience. This library is a package built on top of `@orderly.network/core` and `@orderly.network/perp`.

## Coding standards

- If the hook returns an array, then the first element will be the actual data, and the second element will be an object containing some supporting functions.
- All hooks ending with `stream` will update in real-time, via relevant Websocket subscriptions.
- All hooks ending with `query` is a wrapper of an API request.
