`@orderly.network/hooks`

The hooks libraries provides a series of React hooks for React developers to ensure a seamless integration experience. This library is a package built on top of `@orderly.network/core` and `@orderly.network/perp`.

## Coding standards

- If the hook returns an array, then the first element will be the actual data, and the second element will be an object containing some supporting functions.
- All hooks ending with `stream` will update in real-time, via relevant Websocket subscriptions.
- All hooks ending with `query` is a wrapper of an API request.

## List of hooks

### REST & WS API

The REST API hooks can be used to facilitate interacting with Orderly REST & Websocket APIs.

- [useQuery](/sdks/hooks/api/use-query) - `GET` Public API
- [usePrivateQuery](/sdks/hooks/api/use-private-query) - `GET` Private API
- [usePrivateInfiniteQuery](/sdks/hooks/api/use-private-infinite-query) - A version of `usePrivateQuery` that supports infinite scrolling
- [useLazyQuery](/sdks/hooks/api/use-lazy-query)
- [useMutation](/sdks/hooks/api/use-mutation) - `POST` APIs
