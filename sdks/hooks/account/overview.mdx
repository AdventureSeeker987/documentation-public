`@orderly.network/hooks` provides the following hooks for handling account-related logic:

- [useAccount](/sdks/hooks/advanced/use-account): Retrieves the current account info and status. With this hook you can also create an account and create an `orderlyKey`.
- [useLeverage](/sdks/hooks/advanced/use-leverage): Retrieves the current account leverage.

## How to integrate wallet?

Since `@orderly.network/hooks` only focus on processing the Orderly business logic, the hooks don't include the function of connecting to the wallet, but they can be easily integrated with third-party wallet connection libraries.

Here are two examples:
