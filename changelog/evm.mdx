        **Introducing the new referral system**

        We've heard your feedback and delivered! The long-awaited Orderly Referral System is finally here, marking a significant milestone in enhancing our platform. Tailored to enrich our community, this system introduces an exciting way for our existing users to connect with new users, strengthening our network through shared rewards.

At the core of this initiative is a straightforward yet rewarding referral mechanism. Users can easily generate a personalized referral code and share it with potential new members.

All endpoints for the referral system can be found under the ["Referral Program"](/build-on-evm/evm-api/restful-api/private/create-referral-code) section.

To learn more about how the Orderly Referral System works, refer to this article.

        **Introducing the new fee structure**

Weâ€™re thrilled to unveil the latest enhancement to our services: the Custom Trading Fee System. This innovative feature introduces a suite of flexible fee-setting options, allowing brokers to tailor fee structures to their unique user bases more effectively than ever before. By departing from the limitations of Orderly's standard fees, brokers now have the freedom to set fees that align perfectly with their strategies and customer profiles.

We believe that this new feature will significantly enhance the developer experience on our platform, offering both improved user satisfaction and a competitive edge in the dynamic trading landscape.

All fee rate settig endpoints are under the ["Fee Setting"](/build-on-evm/evm-api/restful-api/private/update-user-fee-rate) section.

        **Adding New Order Types: Take Profit/Stop Loss**

Traders can now use more order types: stop loss/take profit and positional stop loss/take.

Features include:

**1. Three Trigger Price Options:** Initially available with the Mark Price, with future expansions to include Last Price and Index Price.

**2. Auto-Cancellation of TP/SL Orders:** Take Profit (TP) and Stop Loss (SL) orders will be automatically canceled if the position is closed, ensuring more precise trade management.

**3. Two Types of TP/SL Management:**

**- Full/Entire Position TP/SL:** Apply TP/SL to the entire position with a limit of one maximum TP/SL per position.

**- Partial Position TP/SL:** Offers the flexibility to define the amount of the position to be closed, with a maximum of 10 partial TP and 10 partial SL orders on each side.

This update empowers traders to implement more dynamic and sophisticated trading strategies with enhanced risk management features. As always, we are committed to improving and expanding the capabilities of the Orderly Network to meet the evolving needs of our users.

All "algo order" endpoints are ammended to add the new order types.

        **Introducing Smart Contract trading support**

We are excited to announce the launch of the "Delegate Signer" feature in the Orderly Network, a new feature enabling Smart Contracts to trade. 

It allows Smart Contracts to assign an Externally Owned Account (EOA) to sign trades on their behalf using the EIP-712 signature. This solves the issue of Smart Contracts' inability to sign for trades, broadening trading capabilities on the Orderly platform.

New EIP712 signature types for Delegate Signer functions can be found [here](/build-on-evm/user-flows/wallet-authentication).

New Delegate Signer function on-chain. Docs can be found [here](/build-on-evm/user-flows/wallet-authentication).

New Delegate Signer APIs under ["Delegate Signer"](/build-on-evm/evm-api/restful-api/public/add-delegate-signer) section.
