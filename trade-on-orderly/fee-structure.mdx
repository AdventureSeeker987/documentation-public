title: "Fee Structure"

Orderly implemented a tiered fee structure based on a 30-day volume (separately for Spot and Futures). The fee structure can also be retrieved with our REST API.

<Note>
Fees are subject to change at any time.

<Note>
Brokers also have the ability to set custom fees. Please [reach out](mailto:support@orderly.network) to us if you are looking to set custom fees for your platform.
