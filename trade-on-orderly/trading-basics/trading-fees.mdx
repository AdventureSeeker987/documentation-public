## Overview

Trading fees are the costs you pay to buy, sell, or trade assets on an exchange. These fees are charged as a percentage of the transaction value.

There are two main types of trading fees:

**Maker fees:** These fees are charged to traders who place orders that add liquidity to the market (not instantly filled orders that are added to the book), such as limit orders.

**Taker fees:** These fees are charged to traders who remove liquidity from the market, such as market orders.

## How fees are charged
### Spot Fees
Spot trading fees are deducted from the converted token after every trade (e.g. converting USDC to ETH will incur fees in ETH and vice versa).

### Perpetual Futures Fees
Perpetual Futures trading fees are charged after every trade in USDC and added to the cost position.

## Fee structure
Orderly implemented a tiered fee structure based on a 30-day volume (separately for Spot and Futures). The fee structure can also be retrieved with our REST API.

<Note>
Fees are subject to change at any time.
