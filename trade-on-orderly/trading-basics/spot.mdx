title: "Spot Trading"
---

Spot trading is the buying and selling of actual assets at their current market price. The term "spot" is used because the trade is settled immediately, meaning that the buyer and seller exchange the assets and/or currency right away. This is in contrast to margin trading or futures trading, where trades are settled at a future date and possibly without the trade of the underlying.

On Orderly, all spot markets are traded against USDC without any leverage meaning every trade requires the exchange of USDC.
