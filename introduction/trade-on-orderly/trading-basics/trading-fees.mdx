# Overview

Trading fees are the costs you pay to buy, sell, or trade assets on an exchange. These fees are charged as a percentage of the transaction value.

There are two main types of trading fees:

**Maker fees:** These fees are charged to traders who place orders that add liquidity to the market (not instantly filled orders that are added to the book), such as limit orders.

**Taker fees:** These fees are charged to traders who remove liquidity from the market, such as market orders.
