Orderly has implemented an account structure where each address can have several accounts, one account per front-end that operates on Orderly. 

Account address is derived from the user's wallet address and broker ID they are trading from, thus it is one account per integrator.

User's trading activity, such as trades, fees paid, volume, is compartmentalized by front-end, thus each account is completely independent of each other so trades placed through front-end A cannot be seen or modified through front-end B, even though both accounts are owned by the same wallet. Fee tiers are per account.
