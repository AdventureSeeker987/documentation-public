## Community
### Epoch
The ORDER tokens allocated to retroactive airdrop, trading rewards and market making rewards will be unlocked based on epochs. **One epoch is defined as 14 days, and trading rewards and market making rewards are intended to be unlocked over a period of 200 epochs (approx. 7 years), which is subject to change by the future protocol governance.** 

### Retroactive Airdrop
13.3\% \- 133,000,000 ORDER

13.3\%  or 133,000,000 ORDER will be unlocked at the TGE as the retroactive rewards to early supporters. Please see details in Retroactive Airdrop.

### Trading Rewards
15\% \- 150,000,000 ORDER

Trading rewards from be unlocked over a period of 200 epochs (approx. 7 years), the amount locked per epoch will be decreasing over time. Please see details in Trading Rewards 

### Market Making Rewards
10\% \- 100,000,000 ORDER

Market making rewards will be unlocked over a period of 200 epochs (approx. 7 years), and the unlock will be linear i.e. a fixed 500,000 ORDER per epoch. Please see details in Market Making Rewards .

### Builder Rewards
8.35\% \- 83,500,000 ORDER

As a liquidity infrastructure, the protocol can not succeed without dedicated builders with aligned interests. The builder rewards portion will be given to projects in the form of builder grants based on various criteria such as trading volume, daily active users, new users, and more to incentivize developers to create and take the best consumer products to market. A few grants have been committed to the early builders for their support before the TGE, and the builder grant program is open for new builders too. 

### Future Product Launch
8.35\% \- 83,500,000 ORDER

This portion will be locked until its usage is formally established and communicated.

## Strategic Investors
15\% \- 150,000,000 ORDER

All investors are locked for the first 6 months after TGE, with 3.5 year linear vesting thereafter. There is no cliff or a sudden unlock when the linear vesting starts. 

## Team and Advisors
20\% \- 200,000,000 ORDER

This portion is locked on a 1 year 25% cliff, with 3 year linear vesting thereafter. No team tokens are unlocked prior to the 1 year cliff.

## Foundation
10\% \- 100,000,000 ORDER

This segment of the token supply is specifically designated for the Foundation. Its purpose is to support ORDER liquidity on both CEX and DEX platforms, provide ecosystem grants, foster partnerships, and execute other relevant initiatives. Initially, 31,000,000 ORDER tokens will be made available post TGE to enhance ORDER token liquidity across CEX and DEX. Additionally, 9.05M ORDER tokens are earmarked for pre-arranged marketing partnerships spanning a 2-year duration.

The remaining portion will be retained in the Foundation reserve, with complete transparency regarding its utilization. The Foundation's objective is to ultimately transfer full control of the network to the DAO.
