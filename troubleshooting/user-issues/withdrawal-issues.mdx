<Note>
  Withdrawals to some chains take longer (Polygon for example) because it takes longer to get to
  transaction finality. Withdrawals are not instant and may take a few minutes.
</Note>

If users are having issues with withdrawals please do the following:

<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">
    Check our [Dune dashboard](https://dune.com/orderly_network/orderly-support-dashboard) and check
    if withdrawal went through to any chain. Sometimes users request withdrawal to the wrong chain.

    <Note>
    Make sure to refresh the dashboard before checking.
    </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Step">
  If that wasn't sucessful, please search user's wallet address on [LayerZero explorer](https://layerzeroscan.com/).

A message appears with Ordelry as a source-chain for any withdrawals we have received and processed.

- If a message is in-flight, the withdrawal is processing.
- If a message is delivered, the withdrawal was processed.
- If no message appears, Orderly has not received or processed the withdrawal. Please proceed to next step.
