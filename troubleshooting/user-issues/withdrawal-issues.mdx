title: "Stuck/delayed withdrawals"
---

<Note>
  Withdrawals to some chains take longer (Polygon for example) because it takes longer to get to
  transaction finality. Withdrawals are not instant and may take a few minutes.
</Note>

If users are having issues with withdrawals please do the following:

<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">
    Check our [Dune dashboard](https://dune.com/orderly_network/orderly-support-dashboard) and check
    if withdrawal went through to any chain. Sometimes users request withdrawal to the wrong chain.

    <Note>
    Make sure to refresh the dashboard before checking.
    </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Step">
  If that wasn't sucessful, please go to [LayerZero explorer](https://layerzeroscan.com/) and select "Source: Orderly" to check for any cross-chain message delays.

A list of messages appear with Ordelry as a source-chain for any withdrawals we have received and processed.

- If a message is in-flight and was created 10+ min ago, the withdrawals are seeing delay because of LayerZero cross-chain messages.

 </Step>
  <Step title="Third Step">
  If the above steps weren't sucessful, please send a message to Orderly with

- User's address
- Withdrawal amount
- Approximate time the withdrawal was requested

 </Step>
