Deposits do not reflect immediately in user's account.

If users are having issues with deposits please do the following:

<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">
    Check our [Dune dashboard](https://dune.com/orderly_network/orderly-support-dashboard) and check
    if deposit went through to any broker. Sometimes users deposit on one broker and expect the deposit to be reflected on another broker's site.

    <Note>
    Make sure to refresh the dashboard before checking.
    </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Step">
  If that wasn't sucessful, please send a message to Orderly with

- User's address
- Deposit amount
- Approximate time of deposit.
