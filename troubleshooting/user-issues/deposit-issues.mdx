Deposits do not reflect immediately in user's account.

If users are having issues with deposits please do the following:

<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">
    Check our [Dune dashboard](https://dune.com/orderly_network/orderly-support-dashboard) and check
    if deposit went through to any broker. Sometimes users deposit on one broker and expect the deposit to be reflected on another broker's site.

    If the deposit is seen on the Dune dashboard, the funds are in the user's account and most likely a front-end issue if the balance is not displaying.

    <Note>
    Make sure to refresh the dashboard before checking.
    </Note>

    <Note>
    Deposits times vary based on chain. Polygon deposit requires 500 block confirmations which takes about 20 minutes.
    </Note>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Step">
  If that wasn't sucessful, please send a message to Orderly with

- User's address
- Deposit amount
- Approximate time of deposit.
