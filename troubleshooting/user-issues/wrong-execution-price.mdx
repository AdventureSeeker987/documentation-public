title: "Orders/position not closing at expected prices"
---

**Issue Description:**

Users find that their trading positions do not close at the set limit prices, affecting expected gains or losses.

**Troubleshooting Steps:**

- Confirm that the order was placed correctly and at the intended price.
- Check for any slippage due to market volatility or liquidity issues.
- Review the trading history to verify the order execution details.

<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">
    Confirm that the order was placed correctly and at the intended price.

    - If it is a limit order, check if a proper limit price was provided by the user and execution price is:

    1. greater than or equal to limit price for shorts.
    2. lower than or equal to limit price for longs

    - If it is a market order, check if slippage was provided during order placement, otherwise the price execution is not guaranteed. Execution price will have higher slippage on market orders especially during periods of high volatility.
