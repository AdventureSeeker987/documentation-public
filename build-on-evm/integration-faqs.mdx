  <Accordion title="What is Orderly?">
Orderly Network is a combination of an orderbook-based trading infrastructure and a robust liquidity layer offering spot and perpetual futures orderbooks. Unlike traditional platforms, Orderly doesnâ€™t have a front end; instead, it operates at the core of the ecosystem, providing essential services to projects built on top of it.

Our DEX white-label solution is carefully crafted to save builders time and capital while granting access to our bootstrapped liquidity. Picture having the best features of CEXs while keeping settlements on-chain and maintaining full self-custody.

With Orderly, anyone can create a trading application thanks to our seamless plug-and-play experience leveraging our liquidity and composability.

Looking ahead, our grand vision is to create an omnichain protocol, connecting traders from both EVM and non-EVM chains within the same orderbook.
