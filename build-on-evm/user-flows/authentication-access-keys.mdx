## Authentication

Orderly Network relies on the [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) standard to authenticate wallets and accounts for critical actions, such as:

* Account creation

* Access key (Orderly key) addition

* Withdrawal requests

For these actions, wallet owners will need to sign specific messages from their wallet and pass the signature through the REST APIs to complete the action. The following sections describe the steps needed to complete these actions.

In addition, depositing into Orderly Network is a direct on-chain transaction that requires signing from the wallet owner.

For other actions, such as calling trading-related RESTful APIs, only the Orderly Key is required.

### Access key (Orderly key)

Orderly Network uses the ed25519 elliptic curve standard for access keys. Users can generate access keys using any public ed25519 libraries (such as [this one](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@noble/ed25519)) and then be added to any account through a REST API.

Access keys can have different scopes. A `read` scope API can access all private read-only APIs, and a `trading` scope can, in addition, access all order APIs (create order, batch create order, edit order, cancel order, cancel order by client\_order-Id, cancel orders in bulk, batch cancel orders, batch cancel orders by client\_order\_id).

Access keys also have expirations for security reasons. The maximum allowed expiration of an access key is 365 days.

## Add Orderly key

Follow the following steps to add a new access key on Orderly Network:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate an ed25519 key-pair">
    Any public ed25519 library can be used (such as [this one](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@noble/ed25519)).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain signature from EIP-712">
    Sign a message from the wallet in the following format using the EIP-712 standard and obtain the signature

```json
{
    "brokerId": "woofi_dex",
    "chainId": 80001,
    "orderlyKey": "ed25519:HqN9uKJioHjAJZbadgQRGzq2e7huKg6foCyNY43hWbCk",
    "scope": "trading",
    "timestamp": 1685973094398,
    "expiration": 1686081094398
}
```

| scope      | string    | Y            | valid scopes are `read` and `trading`. Multiple scopes can be sent, comma separated                         |
