## Deposit

Token deposits can be made on any supported chains (list [here](trade-on-orderly/supported-chains))

To create a deposit request, users can follow the following steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Approve spending of the token by the smart contract">
  </Step>
  <Step title="Call the `deposit` function of the smart contract">
    Contains the following structured data:
    ```json
    struct DepositData {
      bytes32 accountId;
      bytes32 brokerHash;
      bytes32 tokenHash;
      uint128 tokenAmount;
    }
    ```
    where:
| **Name**    | **Type** | **Required** | **Description**                                       |
| ----------- | -------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| accountId   | bytes    | Y            | The account id of the user in bytes.                  |
| brokerHash  | bytes    | Y            | The keccak256 hash of the broker id (eg "woofi\_dex") |
| tokenHash   | bytes    | Y            | The keccak256 hash of the token string (eg “USDC“)    |
| tokenAmount | int      | Y            | Amount of tokens to be deposited                      |
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Deposits will take some time to reflect depending on the origin chain, to allow for finalizing of the cross-chain transaction involved in the deposit. Once the deposit is credited, the balance will update and the transaction can be seen on the [Get asset history API](/build-on-evm/evm-api/restful-api/private/get-asset-history).
</Note>

## Withdrawal

Follow the following steps to withdraw your tokens from Orderly Network:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a valid chain to withdraw your funds to">
    A list of supported chains can be found on our [Smart Contract Addresses page](/build-on-evm/smart-contract-addresses).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check if the chain has sufficient liquidity">
    All vault contracts can be found on our [Smart Contract Addresses page](/build-on-evm/smart-contract-addresses).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain a withdrawal nonce">
    Get a nonce from [Get Withdrawal Nonce API](/build-on-evm/evm-api/restful-api/private/get-withdrawal-nonce).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain a signature from EIP-712">
    Sign an EIP-712 message in the following format

```json
{
    "brokerId": "woofi_dex",
    "chainId": 80001,
    "receiver": "0x036Cb579025d3535a0ADcD929D05481a3189714b",
    "token": "USDC",
    "amount": 1000000,
    "withdrawNonce": 1,
    "timestamp": 1685973017064
}
```

| brokerId      | string    | Y            | Broker ID, the valid list can be found \[here\]                                                              |
| chainId       | int       | Y            | Chain ID of the chain that the funds should be withdrawn to (within those that are supported by the Network) |
| receiver      | string    | Y            | Address of the receiver, which should be equal to the address of the account.                                |
| token         | string    | Y            | The string representation of the token that is being withdrawn (eg "USDC")                                   |
| amount        | int       | Y            | Amount of tokens to be withdrawn                                                                             |
| withdrawNonce | int       | Y            | Valid withdrawal nonce from [Get Withdrawal Nonce API](/build-on-evm/evm-api/restful-api/private/get-withdrawal-nonce)                                                       |

  </Step>
  <Step title="Make a withdraw request">
    Call the [Create withdraw request API](/build-on-evm/evm-api/restful-api/private/create-withdraw-request).
  </Step>
