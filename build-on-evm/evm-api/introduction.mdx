We provide two interfaces to communicate between Orderly Network and clients. 

[RESTful API interface](#restful-api): Provides sending events like create order, cancel order, fetch balance, etc.

[Websocket interface](#websocket-api): Provides real-time orderbook data feed and order update feed.


## Base endpoints

`https://api-evm.orderly.org/` **(Mainnet)**

`https://testnet-api-evm.orderly.org` **(Testnet)**

## General Information on REST Endpoints

For `GET` and `DELETE` endpoints, parameters must be sent as a `query string`.

For `POST` and `PUT` endpoints, the parameters must be sent in the `request body` with content type `application/json`.

Parameters may be sent in any order.

## Authorization 
All our private interfaces require keys to access.  
Please set the corresponding header in your request. See refer to [Authentication](https://orderly.network/docs/build-on-evm/evm-api/authentication) for more information.

## Symbol  
Orderly Network uses the format of `<TYPE>_<BASE>_<QUOTE>` to represent a symbol name, for example: `PERP_NEAR_USDC` means that it is `NEAR_USDC` pair in `PERP` trading market.

## Rate Limit
Rate limit is counted using the Orderly key. If your application reached the rate limit of certain endpoint, the server will return an error result with http code `429`. You may need wait until next time horizon.

## Error Message 

> **Errors consist of three parts: an error code, detailed message and a success flag.**

```js
{
  "success": false,
  "code": -1005, // Error code
  "message": "order_price must be a positive number" // Detail message  
}
```

All API will return following json when api fails, the "message" will contain the detail error message, it may be because some data are in wrong format, or other reasons.  
Specific error codes and messages are defined in [Error Codes](https://orderly.network/docs/build-on-evm/evm-api/error-codes).
