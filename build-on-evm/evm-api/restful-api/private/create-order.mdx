`POST /v1/order`

Place order maker/taker, the order executed information will be update from websocket stream.
will response immediately with an order created message.

`MARKET` type order behavior: it matches until the full size is executed. If the size is too large (larger than whole book) or the matching price exceeds the price limit (refer to `price_range`), then the remaining quantity will be cancelled.

`IOC` type order behavior: it matches as much as possible at the order_price. If not fully executed, then remaining quantity will be cancelled.

`FOK` type order behavior: if the order can be fully executed at the order_price then the order gets fully executed otherwise would be cancelled without any execution.

`POST_ONLY` type order behavior: if the order will be executed with any maker trades at the time of placement, then it will be cancelled without any execution.

`ASK` type order behavior: the order price is guranteed to be the best ask price of the orderbook at the time it gets accepted.

`BID` type order behavior: the order price is guranteed to be the best bid price of the orderbook at the time it gets accepted.

`visible_quantity` behavior: it sets the maximum quantity to be shown on orderbook. By default, it is equal to order_quantity, negative number and number larger than `order_quantity` is not allowed. If it sets to 0, the order would be hidden from the orderbook. It doesn't work for `MARKET`/`IOC`/`FOK` orders since orders with these types would be executed and cancelled immediately and not be shown on orderbook. For `LIMIT`/`POST_ONLY` order, as long as it's not complete, `visible_quantity` is the maximum quantity that shown on orderbook.

`order_amount` behavior: for `MARKET`/`BID`/`ASK` order, order can be placed by `order_amount` instead of `order_quantity`. It's the size of the order in terms of the quote currency instead of the base currency. The order would be rejected if  both `order_amount` and `order_quantity` are provided. The precision of the number should be within 8 digits.

`client_order_id` behavior: customized order_id, a unique id among open orders. Orders with the same `client_order_id` can be accepted only when the previous one if completed, otherwise the order will be rejected.

For `MARKET`/`BID`/`ASK` order, `order_amount` is not supported when placing SELL order while `order_quantity` is not supported when placing BUY order.

For `reduce_only` parameter, it is only available when order type is `MARKET` or `LIMIT`.
